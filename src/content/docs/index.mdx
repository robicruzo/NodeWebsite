NODE’s backend is a FastAPI service protected by JWT bearer tokens. Use this site to learn how to authenticate and call the key endpoints (users, datasets, nodesets, graphs).

## Quick Start
1. Create a `.env` file (or use Docker) and run the backend on `http://localhost:8000`.
2. Obtain a token via `POST /token` with your email and password.
3. Attach `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` to every request.
4. Upload datasets, create nodesets, and generate graphs using the endpoints documented here.

## Sections
- [Authentication](../reference/authentication/) – token issuance, refresh, logout, password policy.
- [Users API](../reference/users/) – create, list, update, and deactivate accounts.
- [Datasets API](../reference/datasets/) – upload and manage survey datasets.
- [Nodesets API](../reference/nodesets/) – build subsets of dataset variables/respondents.
- [Graphs API](../reference/graphs/) – generate and maintain network visualizations.

Need help from the UI? Launch the app at `http://localhost:5173`, and open the FastAPI explorer at `http://localhost:8000/docs` to run live requests.
